        How long are you awake in the morning before you go online? Perhaps it’s while you’re still lying in bed, using a news 
        feed or social media as the needed stimulant to push you out from under the covers. Or maybe you wait to open your device 
        until after a warm shower and cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, you might say you never signed off in the 
        first place.</p>
                
        <p class="content_1">And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is probably what enabled you to stay in touch with family, 
        or complete entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this sounds familiar, then you live in a part of the world 
        where an internet connection now counts as an essential utility — one that’s as easy to take for granted as the natural 
        gas heating your shower water or the electricity powering your coffee maker.</p>
                
                
        <p class="content_1">But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally, just over 55% of today’s households have an internet 
        connection. This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is referred to as the digital divide, and access is skewed 
        toward richer nations. The gap is projected to close in the next decade as billions of homes connect to the internet 
        for the first time and by 2030 it’s estimated that the technology industry could account for 20% of the global electricity 
        demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On one hand, it supports livelihoods, educations, and bolsters the global 
        economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps, websites, and services that we build will place an even greater 
        strain on our already-overloaded power grids.</p>
